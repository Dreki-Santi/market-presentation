        <p>Did you know I got this all done last night/this morning!!! LOL</p>
        <p>I have made this small site because I wanted to show case what could be done in a short amount of time and to of course show my dedication. It's not the best, but I figured it would be better than making a presentation, I had a lot of hopes for this assignment, but couldnt get it all done before the deadline I gave myself.</p>

        <h2>Questions I Asked Myself</h2>
        <p>Who are we?</p>
        <p>What is it that actually sets us apart?</p>
        <p>How aggressive are we willing/wanting to be?</p>
        <p>What actions are already being made?</p>
        <p>What metrics are we using to know how we are doing?</p>
        <p>Who is our target customer/what groups are we trying to appeal to?</p>
        <p>How involved are we with the community?</p>
        <p>What are we willing to do and not to do?</p>
        <p>Where is our demographic? Digital and IRL.</p>
        <p>Are we getting feedback?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="rightside">
        <h2>What's important?</h2>
        <p>DO we have a written out game plan? We should already have holiday events already planned out for the year. Even if it's just a list of ideas for us to go through as they start approaching! We also need to start setting dates for any kind of events we can do, aside from holidays. Especially the months with nothing to celebrate or take advantage of.</p>
        <p>Digital Marketing. I've essentially been stalking Nash anywhere and everywhere I could. Youtube, Facebook, Tic-Toc, Instagram. Honestly, we are making strides and getting content out, which is awesome! That being said, it feels like there is no focus or consistency. The plan for this would be to get some kind of posting schedule set for each platform. Not only that, but it would be benficial to come up with ideas for new content to post. </p>
        <p>To add on to the digital marketing, we need to start giving ourselves goals to hit for the metrics. Whether that likes, comments, or the most important in my opion, shares. </p>
        <p>Community Engagement. What can we do to get more involved with the community? Example: RideNow is partnered with Team Arizona. Which means the new riding community already has a dealership to check out and know. <b>Do we have our hands in anything? If so, what? If not, why aren't we?</b></p>
        <p>Are we getting feedback? From customers and our Nash Team? This is on here twice because most importantly, we need to be open to change and take every idea we can get. It's just like flipping someone onto a new machine, the customer has an idea what they want and we need to make that idea better.</p>
